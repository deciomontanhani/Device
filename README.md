# DeviceAM - Introduction

This project was made by five undergraduate students of Information Systems, at FIAP, in order to study a little bit more about .NET and 
deliver what was asked by the teacher.

We created a portal with authentication to the administrator, with the functionalities to insert, update and delete informations about the
website, like news and descriptions about the devices that we sell. The administrator also can control the investors and clients that
submitted their informations on the website.
